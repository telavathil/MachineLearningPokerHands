Option 1

the model does not weight a guess of class by the cost of a failed prediction

build a new data frame from a matrix created from each of the rbinds of all the predicted vales from each of the models 

apply strength to each predictor by multiplying classifier accuracy

the matrix will have a label defined by a function that wieghts row values based on their strength of hand.

use this data frame to build to build a new model separated into training and validation

Option 2

take the sensisitivity and specificy of each true value in the matrix, transform them by the by multiplying the accuracy by the 1/T values in each element of the prediction and normalize it, then choose the largest value.
