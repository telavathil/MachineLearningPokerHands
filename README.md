# MachineLearningPokerHands
Machine Learning for classification of Poker hands
In order to investigate machine learning algorithms we attempt to build a machine learner that can successfully classify a hand of poker. Poker is a  family of gambling card games involving betting and individual play, whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of players' cards, some of which remain hidden until the end of the game. For our purpose we will build a model that can accept a set of multiple instances of 5 playing cards, and predict which poker hand each combination of cards is.
